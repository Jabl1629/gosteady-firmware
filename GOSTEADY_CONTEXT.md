# GoSteady — Firmware Development Context

## What Is GoSteady?

GoSteady is a smart walker cap — a small device that attaches to a walker leg and estimates distance traveled using onboard IMU sensors. The product targets elderly users and physical therapy patients who need to track mobility without wearing anything on their body.

The prototype development platform is the **Nordic Thingy:91 X** dev board, which will eventually be replaced by a custom PCB for production.

## Hardware: Thingy:91 X

### Key ICs and Their Roles

| IC | Function | Interface | GoSteady Relevance |
|---|---|---|---|
| **nRF9151** | Main application processor + LTE-M/NB-IoT cellular | — | Runs our firmware (`src/*`); TF-M in secure partition. No direct USB, no 2.4 GHz radio. |
| **nRF5340 (app core)** | USB + BLE host | — | Runs our vendored-and-patched connectivity bridge (`bridge_fw/`). Exposes USB CDC-ACM + mass-storage + BLE NUS. |
| **nRF5340 (net core)** | BLE controller | IPC to app core | Runs NCS `ipc_radio` sample, built and flashed automatically by bridge sysbuild. |
| **nRF7002** | Wi-Fi 6 companion | SPI on `spi3` | Not used in v1. |
| **BMI270** | 6-axis IMU (accel + gyro) | SPI (`spi3` @ CS `P0.10`, 10 MHz max, IRQ `P0.06` active-low) | **Primary sensor** — step detection + stride estimation |
| **ADXL367** | Ultra-low-power 3-axis accelerometer | I²C (`i2c2` @ `0x1d`, INT1 `P0.11` active-high) | Secondary/backup accel, wake-on-motion trigger |
| **GD25LE255E SPI NOR Flash (32 MB)** | External storage | SPI (shared `spi3` bus, 8 MHz max) | IMU session logs, MCUboot secondary, modem FOTA staging |

### Board Target

```
thingy91x/nrf9151/ns
```

- `ns` = non-secure — our application runs in the non-secure partition, TF-M handles the secure side
- This is the correct target for all `west build` commands

### Debug/Flash Interface

The Thingy:91 X has **no onboard debugger**. Flashing requires an external SWD probe.

- **Debugger:** external **SEGGER J-Link EDU Mini V2** (S/N `802006700`) connected via 10-pin SWD Tag-Connect to the Thingy:91 X debug header.
- **SW2 switch:** selects which chip SWD targets. `SW2 = nRF91` for application flashing (our default). Flip to `nRF53` only when reflashing the connectivity bridge, then flip back. Wrong position = SWD talks to the wrong chip and silently wastes time.

**USB enumeration:** comes from the **nRF5340 connectivity bridge** (not a J-Link OB, not direct nRF9151 USB). As of M6b we run our own fork (`bridge_fw/`) based on NCS v3.2.4's `applications/connectivity_bridge`. The bridge exposes three USB interfaces simultaneously:

1. **CDC-ACM on `/dev/cu.usbmodem102`** → nRF9151 **uart0** @ 115200 (app console; `LOG_INF` output lands here).
2. **CDC-ACM on `/dev/cu.usbmodem105`** → nRF9151 **uart1** @ 1 Mbaud (our dump / control channel; also the target of BLE NUS tunneling since M6b).
3. **Mass-storage volume** mounted on macOS as **`/Volumes/NO NAME`** (the volume label is literally `NO NAME`, not `THINGY91X` — easy to miss in Finder). Contains `Config.txt` for runtime options (notably `BLE_ENABLED`) and `README.txt`.

The hex-format serial (e.g. `DAE5B718C2209445`) is the bridge's USB serial, not a J-Link OB serial. `802006700` is the external J-Link Mini — these are two separate devices, not two formats of the same ID.

### Physical UART wiring between the two SoCs

The nRF9151 and nRF5340 share two dedicated UART lines on the PCB:

- **uart0 line** ↔ nRF5340 `cdc_acm_uart0` → USB CDC endpoint `/dev/cu.usbmodem102`. Baud: 115200 on both sides. Purpose: nRF9151 app console / log output.
- **uart1 line** ↔ nRF5340 `cdc_acm_uart1` → USB CDC endpoint `/dev/cu.usbmodem105`. Baud: 1 Mbaud on both sides. Purpose: our M5 dump/command channel (LIST / DUMP / DEL / PING / START / STOP / STATUS). Also the target of BLE NUS tunneling after our M6b patch.

**The uart1 baud rate is load-bearing** — see Known Gotchas. Upstream Nordic bridge defaults uart1 to 115200, which produces garbage on the wire because nRF9151 uart1 is at 1 Mbaud. Our `bridge_fw/boards/thingy91x_nrf5340_cpuapp.overlay` pins the bridge-side default to 1 Mbaud.

## Development Environment

### Toolchain

- **nRF Connect SDK (NCS) v3.2.4** installed at `/opt/nordic/ncs/v3.2.4`
- **Toolchain** at `/opt/nordic/ncs/toolchains/185bb0e3b6/`
- **NCS Python 3.12** at `/opt/nordic/ncs/toolchains/185bb0e3b6/bin/python3` (has intelhex, west, and all dependencies)
- **Zephyr RTOS** is the underlying OS (part of NCS)
- **VS Code + nRF Connect Extension Pack** is the IDE

### Critical PATH Issue (macOS)

Jace's `~/.zshrc` prepends Homebrew Python 3.14 and `~/.local/bin` to PATH. This causes `west` (which is Python-based) to use the wrong Python interpreter, which lacks `intelhex` and other NCS dependencies.

**Fix needed:** Change PATH prepends to appends in `~/.zshrc`:
```bash
# WRONG (current):
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.14/bin:$PATH"
export PATH="/Users/jaceblackburn/.local/bin:$PATH"

# CORRECT:
export PATH="$PATH:/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.14/bin"
export PATH="$PATH:/Users/jaceblackburn/.local/bin"
```

**Alternative:** Always use the nRF Connect terminal (VS Code extension → "Open Terminal" or Toolchain Manager → "Open Terminal") which sources the correct NCS environment automatically.

**Manual environment activation** (for any terminal):
```bash
export PATH="/opt/nordic/ncs/toolchains/185bb0e3b6/bin:/opt/nordic/ncs/toolchains/185bb0e3b6/opt/zephyr-sdk/arm-zephyr-eabi/bin:$PATH"
export ZEPHYR_BASE="/opt/nordic/ncs/v3.2.4/zephyr"
```

### Build & Flash Commands

```bash
# Build (with NCS env sourced)
west build -b thingy91x/nrf9151/ns -p auto

# Flash via the external J-Link Mini (SW2 must be in the nRF91 position)
west flash

# Console output: one of the two /dev/cu.usbmodem* CDC endpoints
# exposed by the nRF5340 connectivity bridge. Use screen, minicom,
# or the nRF Terminal in VS Code.
```

### Known Gotchas

Things that have already bitten us at least once. Read before the next hardware bring-up.

**Build / flash:**

- **VS Code build config board must be `thingy91x/nrf9151/ns`.** Easy to accidentally create a build config pointing at `nrf9151dk` — it will build cleanly but produce an image with completely different pin assignments. Symptom: LEDs do the wrong thing, UART is garbage, peripherals don't respond. Sanity check: `build/gosteady-firmware/zephyr/.config` should contain `CONFIG_BOARD="thingy91x"`.
- **`west build -p auto` doesn't pristine-rebuild when you add a new overlay or board file.** CMake's incremental build misses them. Use `-p always` or `rm -rf build/` after adding `boards/*.overlay` or changing partition-manager Kconfig. Hit this once on M2 and once on M3.
- **`west flash` with the nrfutil runner hits `UICR data is not erasable` on nearly every flash.** The runner only erases sectors the new image touches, and our b0 + MCUboot + TF-M + app layout writes UICR on every rebuild. Fix: `nrfutil device erase --serial-number 802006700` before each `west flash`, or use the nrfjprog runner with `--eraseall` (slower but single-command).
- **APPROTECT + ERASEPROTECT lockout on freshly-rescued bridges.** The rescue hex ships with readback protection on; first `west flash` to the nRF5340 fails with `The Application core access port is protected`. Fix: `west flash --recover` wipes both nRF5340 cores and reflashes. Side effect: the bridge's settings-flash gets wiped, which resets `BLE_ENABLED=0` — you have to re-toggle in `Config.txt` after every recover flash. On the nRF9151 (single core), chain recover + program in one invocation so no reset re-asserts the lock between them: `nrfjprog -f NRF91 --recover --program build/merged.hex --verify --reset`.
- **Board stops enumerating on USB-C → bridge firmware is probably corrupt.** Reflash the connectivity bridge from the local Nordic bundle: `nordic resources/thingy91x_mfw-2.0.4_sdk-3.2.1/img_app_bl/thingy91x_nrf53_connectivity_bridge_v3.0.1.hex`, with **SW2 flipped to nRF53**. This recovery is independent of anything wrong on the nRF9151 side. Alternative: reflash our own `bridge_fw/` build.

**Serial / USB:**

- **`cat /dev/cu.usbmodem*` shows a dead console even when the app is logging.** The bridge holds UART RX back until DTR is asserted; plain `cat` doesn't. Use `screen`, `minicom`, `cu`, pyserial, or nRF Terminal — all assert DTR on open.
- **nRF9151 uart1 runs at 1 Mbaud, not 115200.** Always open `/dev/cu.usbmodem105` at `baud=1000000`. CDC host opens trigger bridge-side `SET_LINE_CODING` → bridge physical uart1 reconfigures to match. Opening at the wrong baud just gets you binary garbage, not errors.
- **Stale garbage in the nRF9151's uart1 parser ring-buffer** sticks around if a baud mismatch ever streamed random bytes into it. Symptom: clean commands come back as `ERR unknown`. Fix: send ~10 bare newlines (`\n` × 10) to flush the parser's line state, then retry. The parser treats blank lines as no-ops.

**BLE (M6b):**

- **BLE compiled in, disabled at runtime.** The bridge's `CONFIG_BRIDGE_BLE_ENABLE=y` builds all the NUS code, but `BLE_ENABLED=0` is the runtime default. Enable by editing `Config.txt` on the `/Volumes/NO NAME` mass-storage drive (`BLE_ENABLED=0` → `BLE_ENABLED=1`), then **eject the drive in Finder** (that's what triggers the settings write), then unplug + replug USB. Gets wiped every time we `west flash --recover` the nRF5340.
- **iOS system-level Bluetooth grabs the NUS connection slot.** After iOS sees the Thingy:91 X UART advertising once, it may auto-connect at the OS level, which blocks nRF Connect / Bluefy from establishing their own connection (we configured `CONFIG_BT_MAX_CONN=1`). Symptom: the device shows as "connected" in iPhone Settings → Bluetooth but your BLE client app spins forever on connect. Fix: iPhone Settings → Bluetooth → tap (i) next to "Thingy:91 X UART" → **Forget This Device**. Sometimes need to toggle BT off/on too.
- **nRF Connect iOS UTF-8 text field does *not* interpret `\n` as an escape.** Typing `PING\n` sends the six literal characters `P I N G \ n`, not `P I N G <newline>`. The text field's Return key also doesn't produce a newline byte in practice. For manual testing of newline-terminated commands, use the **Byte Array** format and send hex explicitly (`PING\n` = `50 49 4E 47 0A`). For production use `tools/capture.html` which constructs bytes programmatically.
- **CCCD descriptor (UUID 2902) must be written before notifications fire.** Subscribing to the NUS TX characteristic in nRF Connect is a matter of tapping the triple-down-arrow / "enable notifications" button, which writes `01 00` to the 2902 descriptor on that characteristic. Without it, the device's responses go into the void. Web Bluetooth's `startNotifications()` does this automatically.
- **Bridge uart1 baud was the invisible M6b bug.** The bridge's upstream default for uart1 is 115200; our nRF9151 side is 1 Mbaud. USB CDC opens reconfigure baud dynamically via `SET_LINE_CODING`, but BLE peer-conn events pass `baudrate=0` ("don't change"), so without our `current-speed = <1000000>` in `bridge_fw/boards/thingy91x_nrf5340_cpuapp.overlay`, BLE tunneling would silently run at a baud mismatch. **Don't remove that DTS override.**
- **BLE writes >~240 bytes silently dropped end-to-end (fixed 2026-04-22).** A full 12-field `START` payload is ~270 bytes. Chrome's `writeValueWithoutResponse` enforces ATT_MTU−3 and throws on oversize; the `writeValueWithResponse` fallback uses GATT Prepare+Execute Write, but somewhere in the NUS RX handler → bridge ring-buffer → uart1 path the reassembly is broken, so the 91's command parser never sees a `\n`-terminated line. Symptom: `→ START {...}` logs cleanly on the browser side, no `← OK` or `← ERR` ever returns, `← STATUS active=0` forever, `STOP` → `← ERR not active`. Short commands (`STATUS`, `STOP`, `PING`) always worked because they fit in one ATT write. **Fix lives in `tools/capture.html` `sendCommand`** — chunk outbound writes to ≤180 bytes with `writeValueWithoutResponse`, one chunk per ATT packet. Same bug almost certainly exists if anyone ever writes their own Web BLE client, so the chunking pattern is the rule, not the exception. See the "Key Design Decisions" note on why this is a browser-side workaround rather than a firmware rearchitecture.

> **Serial console status (verified 2026-04-19):**
> - `/dev/cu.usbmodem102` → nRF9151 **uart0** = app console @ 115200 (`<inf> gosteady: heartbeat tick=N` lands here).
> - `/dev/cu.usbmodem105` → nRF9151 **uart1** = modem trace @ 1 Mbaud (silent unless modem trace is enabled).
>
> **DTR gotcha:** the bridge firmware holds UART RX data back on the USB side until the host asserts DTR. Plain `cat /dev/cu.usbmodem102` on macOS does **not** assert DTR and will appear to show the console as dead (a few bytes of noise per minute). Any proper terminal works: `screen /dev/cu.usbmodem102 115200`, `minicom`, `cu -l /dev/cu.usbmodem102 -s 115200`, the nRF Terminal in VS Code, or a pyserial script. Quick pyserial one-liner for scripted checks:
>
> ```bash
> /opt/nordic/ncs/toolchains/185bb0e3b6/bin/python3 -c "
> import serial, time
> s = serial.Serial('/dev/cu.usbmodem102', 115200, timeout=0.5)
> s.dtr = True; time.sleep(0.2); s.reset_input_buffer()
> t0 = time.time()
> while time.time()-t0 < 6:
>     d = s.read(512)
>     if d: print(d.decode('utf-8', errors='replace'), end='')
> "
> ```

## Firmware Repository: gosteady-firmware

### Current State

The repo is at a **BLE-controllable session-logging target** — the walker cap can be sealed and the operator drives `START` / `STOP` wirelessly from a phone. On boot (nRF9151 side): mount LittleFS, bump the boot counter, start a 100 Hz BMI270 sampling thread with a decoupled writer, wire SW0 as a bench-fallback toggle for session start/stop, bring up the uart1 dump/control channel. LED state tells the operator which mode they're in (solid green while recording, purple blink while idle). On the nRF5340 side: our patched connectivity bridge runs, exposing BLE NUS tunneled to uart1. As of **2026-04-21**, **Milestones 1–6 are complete**: toolchain, SDK, J-Link path, build+flash cycle, serial console, sensor drivers, LittleFS, session-file writer, USB host-pull path, BLE session control are all verified against real hardware.

- **M1 (dev env):** `<inf> gosteady: heartbeat tick=N` prints at 1 Hz on `/dev/cu.usbmodem102`.
- **M2 (sensor bring-up):** BMI270 (SPI) and ADXL367 (I²C) both produce sane readings — ~±1 g on the gravity axis at rest, noise-floor-level signal on the other axes. BMI270 is configured at 4 g / 500 dps / 100 Hz per the v1 annotation schema. **Note:** Z-axis signs are opposite between BMI270 (+1 g) and ADXL367 (-1 g) because the two chips are mounted in different orientations on the PCB — handle this at the algorithm fusion layer.
- **M3 (external flash):** LittleFS mounted at `/lfs` on an 8 MB `littlefs_storage` partition carved out of `external_flash` by the NCS partition manager. Persistence verified — `/lfs/boot_count` increments across hardware resets. 4096-byte erase blocks, 512-cycle wear threshold. Partition range: `0x4d2000`–`0xcd2000` (8 MB); remainder of external flash (`0xcd2000`–`0x2000000`, ~19 MB) stays free for future use.
- **M4 (session logging):** 256-byte packed binary header (`src/session.h`) stamps the 13 FIRMWARE + 12 PRE-WALK fields from the v1 annotation schema; body is 28-byte packed sample records (uptime_ms + 3×float accel m/s² + 3×float gyro rad/s) from BMI270 at 100 Hz. UUIDv4 from the TF-M PSA RNG. Files land at `/lfs/sessions/<uuid>.dat`. SW0 short-press toggles start/stop. On close, the header is base64-logged to UART so the host ingest script can round-trip without needing USB mass-storage. Every controlled-vocab enum decodes cleanly through `tools/read_session.py`.
- **M5 (USB dump + sampler decoupling):** `src/dump.c` runs a tiny line protocol on nRF9151 uart1 (routed by the nRF5340 connectivity bridge to `/dev/cu.usbmodem105 @ 1 Mbaud`): `PING`, `LIST`, `DUMP <name>`, `DEL <name>`. `tools/pull_sessions.py` drives the host side — round-trips session files to local disk and cross-validates each with `read_session.py`. Under the hood, `src/session.c` was refactored: sampler thread now only does a non-blocking `k_msgq_put`; a dedicated writer thread drains the queue, batches into `fs_write`, and rewrites the header on close. Rate went from ~96 Hz → **100.08 Hz** (1,300 samples / 12.989 s body duration on a fresh bench session). `flash_errors` now means `dropped_samples` (queue-full events); stays 0 when headroom is adequate. `battery_mv_{start,end}` and `session_*_utc_ms` still stamp 0 until M12 / nPM1300 fuel gauge.
- **M6a (transport-agnostic session control):** `src/control.c` parses `START <json>` / `STOP` / `STATUS` commands using Zephyr's JSON library against a schema mirroring `struct gosteady_prewalk`. All 7 controlled-vocab fields are string-validated against the v1 vocabulary; free-form strings are truncated-copied. The parser writes its response into a caller-provided buffer — transport-agnostic by design, so the M6b BLE bridge can tunnel the same commands from a NUS write without the nRF9151 firmware caring. Wired into `src/dump.c` as an additional dispatch target, so the existing uart1 channel now carries both file ops and session control. `tools/control.py` drives it from the host (supports named presets like `concrete-normal-20` so the operator doesn't hand-type JSON 30 times). End-to-end test: a preset-driven `start → sample → stop → pull` cycle produced a session file whose `course_id`, `intended_distance_ft`, and `operator_id` came through exactly as sent (and the other 9 fields all validate against the canonical vocabulary). The M4 button handler is still wired up as a fallback for bench work while the cap is open. Rate held at ~100 Hz through the JSON path.
- **M6b (BLE control over NUS):** `bridge_fw/` is a vendored fork of Nordic's `applications/connectivity_bridge` with four surgical edits (see `bridge_fw/PATCHES.md`) that retarget the Nordic UART Service from uart0 to uart1 — the latter being where our M5/M6a command parser listens. The nRF5340 net core gets built as `ipc_radio` automatically via sysbuild and programmed alongside the app image. BLE is compiled in upstream but **gated off at runtime by default**; the operator enables it by editing `BLE_ENABLED=0` → `1` in `Config.txt` on the bridge's USB mass-storage endpoint and ejecting. `bridge_fw/boards/thingy91x_nrf5340_cpuapp.overlay` pins the bridge's uart1 default to 1 Mbaud so the BLE path's `baudrate=0` ("don't change") peer-conn event doesn't leave a 115200/1Mbaud mismatch against the nRF9151. **Operator-facing UI:** `tools/capture.html` is a single-file Web BLE page with a preset button per row of the v1 30-run capture matrix and a persistent STOP button; opened in **Bluefy** on iOS (Safari doesn't do Web Bluetooth), it drives the full `START {json} / STOP` cycle over NUS. End-to-end validation: `STATUS` sent from nRF Connect iOS returned `STATUS active=0` as a TX notification through the patched tunnel.

The repo is public on GitHub at `https://github.com/Jabl1629/gosteady-firmware` and also serves the operator UI via GitHub Pages at **`https://jabl1629.github.io/gosteady-firmware/tools/capture.html`** (auto-rebuilds on every push to `main`).

### Build + flash targets

Two separate builds now:

| Target | Board qualifier | Build dir | Flash with SW2 at |
|---|---|---|---|
| nRF9151 app (`src/`) | `thingy91x/nrf9151/ns` | `build/` | **nRF91** |
| nRF5340 bridge (`bridge_fw/`) | `thingy91x/nrf5340/cpuapp` | `build_bridge/` | **nRF53** |

The app rebuild-and-reflash cycle is the frequent path; the bridge only gets reflashed when you're changing the BLE tunnel itself. **Always flip SW2 back to nRF91 after a bridge reflash** or subsequent app flashes will overwrite the wrong chip.

## Algorithm: Distance Estimation

### Current State (Python, validated offline)

A step-based distance estimator developed in Python using data from a prior prototype. Code lives in `GoSteady/null_old_fw/`.

**Pipeline:**
```
IMU data → gravity removal (Butterworth LP 0.5 Hz) → accel magnitude → peak detection → stride regression from peak accel → distance (ft)
```

**Performance (9 calibration runs, polished concrete):**
- Step detection MAE: 0.67 steps
- Distance MAPE: 12.4%
- Distance MAE: 1.21 ft
- All runs within 25% error

**Calibrated parameters:**
- Step detection prominence: 0.15 g
- Step detection min distance: 70 samples (~0.7s at 99.3 Hz)
- Stride regression: `stride_ft = 1.257 × peak_accel_g − 1.052` (R² = 0.84)

### Why Step-Based, Not Dead Reckoning?

Dead reckoning (double-integrating accelerometer) was tested and gives 73% MAPE — unusable. Even 0.001g of bias integrates to feet of phantom displacement. This is a fundamental limitation of low-cost MEMS IMUs.

### Dual-Algorithm Architecture (Production Goal)

The production firmware will support two walker types with different motion models:

**Standard walker (no wheels):** Lift → shift → plant → shuffle. Each step produces a distinct impact spike. The current step detection algorithm targets this pattern.

**2-wheeled walker:** Glide → shuffle. The front wheels stay on the ground, creating a continuous rolling motion with less distinct step boundaries. Needs a different detection approach — likely continuous acceleration integration over glide phases rather than discrete step counting.

**Online walker-type classifier:** Production firmware will include a classifier with hysteresis that detects which walker type is in use and switches between the two distance estimation algorithms. For v1 data collection, we are fixing walker type to 2-wheeled only.

### Surface Effects

Surface friction affects both step/stride dynamics and sensor signatures:
- **Polished concrete:** Low friction, clean glide for wheeled walkers
- **Carpet:** High friction, shorter strides, dampened acceleration peaks
- **Outdoor concrete/sidewalk:** Variable texture, cracks create impulse noise

The IMU's high-frequency content contains surface friction signatures that could enable automatic surface detection. We decided NOT to use a microphone for surface detection — it adds hardware cost, battery drain, and the IMU already captures the needed friction signal.

## Data Collection Plan

The canonical sources for this section are the two files in `data collection and protocols/`:

- **`GoSteady_Capture_Protocol_v1.docx`** — defines the 30-run v1 dataset, prerequisites, run matrix, per-run procedure, and post-session ingest flow.
- **`GoSteady_Capture_Annotations_v1.xlsx`** — the ground-truth spreadsheet. Three sheets: `Captures` (one row per run), `Legend` (column meanings), `Vocabularies` (controlled values). The `session_uuid` column is the primary key tying session files on flash to spreadsheet rows.

> The spreadsheet already has ~15 sample rows with `walker_type=standard`, `cap_type=tacky`, and surfaces outside v1 scope (hardwood, tile, outdoor_concrete). Those are **schema-test fixtures**, not v1 data — they exist to validate the ingest pipeline. The real v1 dataset will be 30 rows with `walker_type=two_wheel` + `cap_type=glide`.

### Scope (v1)

- **Subject:** 1 (S00 = Jace).
- **Walker type:** `two_wheel` only.
- **Cap type:** `glide` only (single physical cap).
- **Surfaces:** `polished_concrete` (indoor), `outdoor_concrete`, `low_pile_carpet` (indoor). 10 runs each = **30 total**.
- **Out of scope (deferred to v2):** standard/tacky dataset, additional subjects, walker-type / surface transition runs, other surfaces (tile, hardwood, vinyl, asphalt), per-subject calibration.

### Prerequisites (before capture can start)

These are hard blockers — capturing data the ingest pipeline can't handle is more expensive than waiting.

- **Session logging to external flash** working end-to-end. ✅ *M4 — `/lfs/sessions/<uuid>.dat` with full versioned header.*
- **Remote `start_session` / `stop_session` with full 12-field PRE-WALK payload** deliverable while the cap is sealed. ✅ *M6a + M6b — `tools/capture.html` over BLE NUS.*
- **Session-file pull path** from host after capture. ✅ *M5 — `tools/pull_sessions.py` over USB uart1.*
- **Ingest validator** that reads each session file's header and cross-checks against the v1 vocabulary. ✅ *`tools/read_session.py`. Not yet a spreadsheet-writing batch-ingest — currently it just validates one file at a time and prints, which is enough for rehearsal; spreadsheet-row auto-population lands in M8 prep if/when needed.*
- **Full end-to-end rehearsal** (BLE start → sealed-cap walk → stop → USB pull → validator pass) covering multiple preset rows. ⚠️ *Not yet passed. This is what the next session should drive to completion.*

### Run Matrix

All 30 runs, pulled from the canonical protocol. `course_id` is the named physical path; `run_type`, `intended_speed`, and `direction` are separate pre-walk fields (not conflated like they were in the old draft).

**Indoor polished concrete (runs 1–10):**

| # | course_id | run_type | dist_ft | speed | direction | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | concrete_A_straight | normal | 10 | normal | straight | warmup |
| 2 | concrete_A_straight | normal | 20 | slow | straight | |
| 3 | concrete_A_straight | normal | 20 | normal | straight | |
| 4 | concrete_A_straight | normal | 20 | fast | straight | |
| 5 | concrete_A_straight | normal | 20 | normal | straight | repeat for variance |
| 6 | concrete_A_long | normal | 40 | normal | straight | long-distance |
| 7 | concrete_A_short | normal | 10 | normal | straight | |
| 8 | concrete_A_curve | normal | 20 | normal | s_curve | weave 2 cones |
| 9 | concrete_A_straight | stationary_baseline | 0 | slow | straight | 30 s parked |
| 10 | concrete_A_straight | stumble | 20 | normal | straight | simulated near-trip |

**Outdoor concrete sidewalk (runs 11–20):** same template. `course_id` prefix `sidewalk_`. Run 19 = `stationary_baseline` (0 ft / 30 s). Run 20 = `pickup` (walker lifted briefly mid-walk, 10 ft).

**Indoor low-pile carpet (runs 21–30):** same template. `course_id` prefix `carpet_A_`. Run 26 is only 30 ft (indoor space limit). Run 28 s-curve is 15 ft (furniture path). Run 29 = `stationary_baseline`. Run 30 = `stumble`.

### Annotation Schema (canonical field names)

These are the exact column names in `GoSteady_Capture_Annotations_v1.xlsx`. Use them verbatim in firmware and ingest code — no synonyms.

**FIRMWARE layer** (stamped into session file header by the device, populated at ingest):
`session_uuid`, `device_serial`, `firmware_version`, `sensor_model`, `sample_rate_hz`, `accel_range_g`, `gyro_range_dps`, `session_start_utc`, `session_end_utc`, `sample_count`, `battery_mv_start`, `battery_mv_end`, `flash_errors`.

**PRE-WALK layer** (sent via BLE `start_session` payload, also stamped into the session file header):
`subject_id`, `walker_type`, `cap_type`, `walker_model`, `mount_config`, `course_id`, `intended_distance_ft`, `surface`, `intended_speed`, `direction`, `run_type`, `operator`.

**POST-WALK layer** (operator fills after the run):
`valid` (Y/N), `manual_step_count`, `actual_distance_ft` (defaults to `intended_distance_ft` unless the subject deviated), `subjective_speed`, `events` (e.g. `stumble@0:07`, semicolon-separated), `discard_reason`, `free_notes`.

**DERIVED layer** (formula-only — do not overwrite):
`duration_s` = `session_end_utc − session_start_utc`, `avg_speed_ft_s` = `actual_distance_ft / duration_s`.

### Controlled Vocabularies

From the `Vocabularies` sheet. Firmware's BLE start-session payload handling and any host-side validation should reject values outside these lists.

| Field | Allowed values |
|---|---|
| `walker_type` | `standard`, `two_wheel` |
| `cap_type` | `tacky`, `glide` |
| `surface` | `polished_concrete`, `low_pile_carpet`, `high_pile_carpet`, `hardwood`, `tile`, `linoleum`, `vinyl`, `outdoor_concrete`, `outdoor_asphalt` |
| `intended_speed` | `slow`, `normal`, `fast` |
| `direction` | `straight`, `turn_left`, `turn_right`, `s_curve`, `pivot` |
| `run_type` | `normal`, `stumble`, `pickup`, `setdown`, `stationary_baseline`, `car_transport`, `chair_transfer`, `turn_test`, `obstacle`, `walker_type_transition`, `surface_transition` |
| `mount_config` | `front_left_leg`, `front_right_leg`, `rear_left_leg`, `rear_right_leg`, `front_crossbar` |
| `valid` | `Y`, `N` |
| `discard_reason` | `bad_mount`, `sensor_glitch`, `incomplete_run`, `wrong_course`, `interruption`, `operator_error` |

### Firmware Implications (status as of M1–M6b)

The schema forces several concrete firmware requirements. Status against what's implemented today:

- ✅ **UUIDv4 generation** at session start for `session_uuid` — done via DTS-chosen entropy (PSA RNG via TF-M).
- ✅ **Session file header format** serializes all 13 FIRMWARE + 12 PRE-WALK fields. Versioned (`GOSTEADY_SESSION_VERSION=1`, 256-byte packed struct).
- ✅ **BLE `START` accepts + validates the full 12-field PRE-WALK payload** — Zephyr JSON library against `prewalk_descr` schema; all 7 controlled-vocab fields string-validated against the v1 vocabulary before firmware stamps anything. Invalid → `ERR <reason>`, no silent defaults.
- ✅ **Flash integrity counter** — bumped on `k_msgq_put` failure (queue full = sample dropped). Reported as `flash_errors` in the header.
- ⚠️ **RTC with UTC time** for `session_start_utc` / `session_end_utc`. Currently stamps `0` as a "not yet synced" sentinel. Waiting on M12 (cellular LTE time sync) or an alternative host-side stamp at ingest.
- ⚠️ **Battery voltage** in millivolts, measured at both session start and end. Currently stamps `0`. Needs nPM1300 fuel-gauge wiring (separate side quest; ~half a day of work with `nrf_fuel_gauge` lib).

### Per-Run Procedure (operator side, abbreviated)

1. Confirm the next run's `intended_distance_ft`, `intended_speed`, `direction`, `run_type` from the matrix.
2. Tape-measure the course; mark start/end; place cones for `s_curve` runs.
3. Position the walker with a consistent convention (e.g. front wheels on start line).
4. From laptop, send BLE `start_session` with the full pre-walk payload.
5. Wait for confirmation + 1 s stationary settling period.
6. Walk the course. For `stationary_baseline` leave the walker parked 30 s. For `stumble` / `pickup` introduce the event at mid-walk and note the timestamp.
7. Stop at end line, 1 s settling, then BLE `stop_session`.
8. Log any `actual_distance_ft` deviation and `events` with timestamps in the run log.
9. ~30 s gap before next run (clean boundary for sensors + flash log).

### Post-Session Ingest

Run after completing all 10 runs on a surface, always before closing out the session:

1. Disassemble cap, connect Thingy:91 X via USB, mount flash (mass-storage) or use CDC dump.
2. Copy all new session files to `/raw_sessions/<capture_date>/`. Verify file count == runs executed. **Do not delete anything from the device if counts mismatch — investigate first.**
3. Run batch-ingest script → appends one row per `session_uuid` to the annotation spreadsheet, auto-filling FIRMWARE + PRE-WALK columns.
4. Operator fills POST-WALK columns from run-log notes.
5. Sanity check each row: non-zero `sample_count`, zero `flash_errors`, `duration_s` within a few seconds of intended (except `stationary_baseline`).
6. Commit raw_sessions + updated spreadsheet to the dataset archive — this is the v1 capture deliverable.

## Immediate Next Steps

Milestones 1–6 are done but the **M6b BLE capture page has open questions** that need to be worked through before we can rehearse the real v1 protocol. Picking up:

### 1. Set up Safari Web Inspector → Bluefy (highest priority)

We were hitting the context window just as the capture page's button-tap path needed debugging, so this is the first thing the next session should do. The in-page Log panel catches some things but Safari's full DevTools over USB is what we actually need.

**On iPhone:** Settings → Apps → Safari → Advanced → toggle **Web Inspector** on.

**On Mac:** Safari → Settings → Advanced → check **Show Develop menu in menu bar**.

**To debug:** USB-connect phone, open the capture page in Bluefy on phone, then on Mac go to Safari → Develop → *[your iPhone name]* → **Bluefy** → the Bluefy tab. You get full Chrome-like DevTools: Console, Network, Elements, Sources, breakpoints, the whole thing.

### 2. Work through the suspected `capture.html` issues

Known / suspected from the last session:

- **Run buttons may still not fire** after connect — the fix committed in `250ca57` adds a `renderMatrix()` call in `onConnected()` so the row buttons pick up the newly-available `rxChar`. Needs verification via Safari Web Inspector that taps register and `sendCommand('START ...')` actually runs.
- **STOP button** — was reported as not working, but its disabled-state logic is independent of session state (just requires `rxChar`), so it *should* be live once connected. Confirm in dev tools.
- **Full start/wave/stop/pull round-trip over BLE from the cap** has **not yet been verified end-to-end**. Bench-level BLE writes showed `STATUS active=0` returning cleanly through the tunnel (after the baud fix), but a full `START <full-12-field JSON>` → sampler runs → `STOP` → session file on flash with all fields correct → cleanly pulled via `tools/pull_sessions.py` → cleanly validated via `tools/read_session.py` has not been completed end-to-end. That validation is the gate for declaring the capture pipeline ready for M8.
- **The JSON round-trip specifically** is the part most likely to hide bugs — the ~270-char START payload rides a BLE NUS characteristic through a ring-buffer ratio on the bridge side, through a 1 Mbaud UART, into our `read_line` that expects `\n` termination. Anywhere in that path, partial writes or MTU fragmentation could truncate or misalign. Test with several different preset payloads and verify every PRE-WALK field landed in the header.

### 3. Once the capture page is solid → rehearse, then M8

**Rehearsal:** full 30-row capture protocol with the cap sealed, phone driving via the capture page. Post-rehearsal, disassemble, pull files via `tools/pull_sessions.py --rm`, validate every header, check for any dropped samples, flash_errors, or field drift. Issues feed back as small fixes.

**After rehearsal passes:** M8 real data collection. At that point, M7 (dedicated Python CLI wrapping BLE + USB) may be unnecessary — the current toolset (`capture.html` for BLE control, `pull_sessions.py` for USB dump, `read_session.py` for validation) already covers the operator workflow. Only fold these into a single CLI if the workflow reveals a need.

## Host-side operator tooling

Four tools, all in `tools/`. They share the same line-protocol with the firmware; they differ only in transport and UX.

| Tool | Transport | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `tools/capture.html` | BLE NUS via Bluefy on iOS | Operator UI during a sealed-cap capture run. 30 preset buttons from the v1 matrix; big STOP button pinned at the bottom; auto-opens a response log on connect. Completion badges persisted in `localStorage`. Served at **`https://jabl1629.github.io/gosteady-firmware/tools/capture.html`** (GitHub Pages). |
| `tools/control.py` | USB `/dev/cu.usbmodem105` @ 1 Mbaud | Bench equivalent of `capture.html` for when the cap is open. Same `START` / `STOP` / `STATUS` commands, same preset dict as `capture.html`, plus a `raw` subcommand for arbitrary lines. |
| `tools/pull_sessions.py` | USB `/dev/cu.usbmodem105` @ 1 Mbaud | Post-session file pull. `LIST`s the session directory, `DUMP`s each file to local disk (`./sessions/<uuid>.dat` by default), optionally `DEL`s on device with `--rm`. |
| `tools/read_session.py` | — (offline) | Parses a pulled `.dat` file or a base64 header string, validates every controlled-vocab field against the v1 vocabulary, prints FIRMWARE + PRE-WALK + body summary. Used as both a dev validator and a dry-run ingest. |

**Firmware-side command protocol** (same on USB uart1 and BLE NUS after M6b):

```
PING\n              → PONG\n
STATUS\n            → STATUS active={0|1}\n
START <json>\n      → OK started\n    (or ERR <reason>\n)
STOP\n              → OK samples=N\n  (or ERR not active\n)
LIST\n              → <name> <size>\n ... END\n
DUMP <name>\n       → SIZE <n>\n <n raw bytes> \nOK\n
DEL <name>\n        → OK\n            (or ERR <reason>\n)
```

All commands are newline-terminated. `\n` is a literal `0x0A` byte — no escape-sequence parsing.

## Key Design Decisions Made

**Algorithm / sensing:**
- **Step-based, not dead reckoning** — dead reckoning gives 73% MAPE with MEMS IMUs, unusable.
- **Accelerometer magnitude** for step detection — orientation-independent (`sqrt(x² + y² + z²)`).
- **Stride regression from peak acceleration** — no speed label needed, 12.4% MAPE.
- **No microphone** for surface detection — IMU high-frequency content has the friction signal, mic adds cost/power/board complexity.
- **BMI270 is the session recorder; ADXL367 is the power switch** — the 7-column `.dat` format the Python algorithm expects requires accel + gyro, which only BMI270 provides. ADXL367 stays online as a sanity print in M2+ and will be used for wake-on-motion in the later power-optimization milestone.

**Scope / platform:**
- **v1 data collection is single-walker, single-cap, 3 surfaces** — complexity deferred to v2.
- **Thingy:91 X as dev platform** — production will use a custom PCB with its own BLE + cellular silicon, so bridge firmware work here is prototype-only.
- **`thingy91x/nrf9151/ns`** as build target — non-secure application core, TF-M in secure partition.

**M4–M6 architecture:**
- **Binary session file with versioned 256-byte header** — `_Static_assert`ed on-device, `struct.calcsize`'d on-host, so C/Python drift fails loudly on either side.
- **Sampler thread decoupled from fs_write via k_msgq** — sampler's only job is "sample and enqueue"; a dedicated writer thread batches flash writes. Rate went 96 Hz → 100 Hz when we made this change; `flash_errors` now means "queue-full drops" rather than "fs_write short-returns".
- **Transport-agnostic command parser** (`src/control.c`) — same parser handles USB uart1 and BLE NUS. Adding a new transport (cellular in M12? another BLE service?) is a nRF5340-side change only.
- **BLE, not cellular, for v1 operator control** — operator is always in the room during capture; phone-in-pocket + Bluefy page is the right UX. Cellular is overkill for v1 and adds indoor-coverage / backend failure modes that would kill data capture. Cellular is M12/M13 for production telemetry upload, not session control.
- **Don't delete bad runs, mark `valid=N`** — canonical per v1 capture protocol. Firmware has a `DEL` command available to the ingest script for deliberate cleanup, but the operator UI (`capture.html`) has no delete button. All files survive to post-session review.
- **Bridge firmware vendored wholesale** into `bridge_fw/` rather than patched at build-time. 264 KB of Nordic source in the repo is fine; the build-system fragility of a patch-on-build approach would be worse.
- **Browser-side chunking of BLE writes instead of slimming the protocol (2026-04-22).** Found during M6b end-to-end validation: the ~270-byte `START` JSON doesn't make it through the BLE NUS RX → bridge → uart1 path (see Known Gotchas). Considered moving to a short `START <uuid>` with host-side metadata and lean session headers, which is architecturally cleaner and closer to how cellular telemetry will look in M12+. Chose instead to chunk the outbound write at ≤180 B in `capture.html` and keep session files fully self-describing, because (a) the chunking patch is 6 lines and ~10 min to ship; (b) a lean rewrite touches `control.c`, `session.h/c`, `capture.html`, `control.py`, `read_session.py` plus re-validation on hardware, a 1–2 day cost against the immediate goal of v1 capture; (c) self-describing session files preserve metadata recoverability if the host-side state is ever lost between `START` and ingest; (d) the natural time to revisit is M12–M14 when we're wiring cellular + backend + custom PCB anyway — the lean protocol falls out of that work informed by production requirements, not a guess.
- **Web BLE page on GitHub Pages**, not a native iOS app — a single static HTML file shipped from the repo auto-redeploys on every push, and iOS via Bluefy gives us NUS access without the React Native / Flutter BLE dance. Native app can come later if needed.

**Runtime gates we know about:**
- `BLE_ENABLED=1` in `Config.txt` on `/Volumes/NO NAME` — gets wiped by `west flash --recover`, needs re-toggle after.
- iOS "Forget This Device" after every bridge reflash or iOS occupies the single BLE connection slot.
